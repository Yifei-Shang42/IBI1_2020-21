Improvements I made responding to the Formative Feedback:

1. In Practical5/variables.py, I initially set a = 020502, which was not valid, this statement was changed to a = 20502.

2. In Practical5/mystery_code.py, I changed my original description of the function of the code into a more detailed one, which involved the function of randint(1, 100).
    The answer is now correct.

No further improvements except the above two were available according to my formative feedback.

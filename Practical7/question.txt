Start Line Number: 
76

Discussion: 
Numbers of new cases and total cases are almost 0 before 2020-03-08.
From 2020-03-08 to 2020-03-27, number of new cases steadily increases.
After 2020-03-27, number of new cases begins to mildly decrease.
from 2020-03-08, number of total cases increases drastically.

From the plot we can conclude that first case in Spain was confirmed early March 2020.
Number of new cases starts to decrease from 2020-03-27. 
This suggests after 2020-03-13 (considering infection was confirmed 14 days later), effective actions were taken to prevent the spread of the virus.

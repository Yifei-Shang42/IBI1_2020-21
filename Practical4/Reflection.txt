Reflection about Practical 4

I encountered the following problems:

1. There was a merge conflict when I was trying two merge the 2 branches.

	Solution: I edited thingsIlike.txt to a version I liked and commited again. I then used "git log --graph --oneline" and found out the merge was successful.

2. When using "git clone" I could not connect and kept getting 443 timeout error messages.
	
	Solution: I used "git clone git://github.com/..." as in "Bioinformatics Data Skills" by Vince Buffalo instead of "git clone https://github.com/...".

3. When using "git push" I got an error message saying I should push to "https://github.com/,,," instead of "git://github.com/...".

	Solution: This is related to problem No.2 because I used a different command to clone.

		  I then changed "origin" to the complete https path in command "git push origin master" and it worked.

Summary:
	This was a really challenging practical but it was fun at the same time. 

	I learned much more than merely the content in the practical guide.
	
	This practical also improve my online searching skill.
